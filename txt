Hi [Attorney’s Name],

Thank you for your detailed assessment and recommendations. I agree with your impression that the review standard applied here feels closer to the EB-1A/B level, particularly in how they handled the “well-positioned” prong. I appreciate the clear outline of the supplemental evidence and strategy options.

I’d like to schedule a meeting with you to discuss the approach in more depth. I’m available this Friday (my last working day before paternity leave) at the following times (ET):

11:00 am – 12:00 pm

1:00 pm – 2:30 pm

3:30 pm – 5:00 pm

I’ll be starting paternity leave next Monday, with my first baby’s due date on August 30. I expect to have some time to focus on the NIW response before the birth.

Should we include Nalanda in this meeting so she’s aware of the type of documentation and evidence preparation she can support? Or would you prefer that we first meet to clarify the strategy, and then bring her in afterward?

I will also work on some preparation notes and strategy ideas from my side and send them over before our meeting.

Best regards,
Chester
